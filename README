This branch was fully merged on the 1st of May, 2012 into the master it 
forked from, so it is of little use on its own since that merger,

This branch is a fork of the git master of FBReaderJ (as of midnight, 
the 23rd of April, 2012), plus three more files that translate FBReaderJ 
into the Portuguese language.

The translation from English to Portuguese was done by 
http://www.gototranslation.com

The translation work was sponsored by Panacea Supplies
